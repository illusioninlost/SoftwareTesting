cs320 Software Test Automation

In order to ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure I educate myself and train others on the software development cycle. Part of the learning involves the use of software testing. I learn and adapt new ways to automated software to avoid technical bugs, provide better fixes, improve software systems, and document to the best of my ability. 

For me to interpret user needs, I listen to what the user offers as needs in the program. Additional feedback is greatly appreciated. I incorporate most of the user by breaking down the ideas into steps or user stories. Each software requirement meets the interest of the program and user needs. 

I approached software designing with a step-by-step approach and follow the software development lifecycle. Software testing or better, software automation testing help to streamline the application from development to deployment easily. Designing good software takes time and practice. Much of the repeated tasks may match an automation role. 



Questions:

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

How do I approach designing software?
